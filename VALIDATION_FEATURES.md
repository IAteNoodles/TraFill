# Validation & Duplicate Prevention Features

## Overview

The application now includes comprehensive validation features to prevent duplicate entries and warn about financial services companies that are typically not needed for outreach tracking.

## Features

### 1. üö´ Duplicate Contact Prevention

The system **automatically blocks** submission if any of the following contact details already exist in the database:

- **Email address**
- **Phone number**
- **LinkedIn profile URL**

#### How It Works

1. Before submission, the system checks if the entered email, phone, or LinkedIn already exists
2. If a match is found, submission is **blocked** (not just warned)
3. A detailed error message shows:
   - Which contact method(s) matched
   - The existing company name
   - Who added the entry
   - Current status
   - Date of entry

#### Example Scenario

```
‚ùå DUPLICATE ENTRY BLOCKED!

This contact information (email, LinkedIn) already exists in the database:

Company: TechCorp Solutions
Added by: John Doe
Status: In Progress
Date: 2025-10-15

Please do not create duplicate entries!
```

**Action**: Entry is **NOT submitted**. User must change contact details or abandon the entry.

### 2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Company Already Contacted Warning

If the company name already exists in the database, the system:

1. **Warns** the user (does not block)
2. Shows how many times this company has been contacted
3. Displays details of the previous entry(s)
4. Asks for confirmation: "Are you contacting a DIFFERENT person at this company?"

#### Example Scenario

```
‚ö†Ô∏è COMPANY ALREADY IN DATABASE

"Google Inc" has already been contacted 3 time(s).

Previous entry:
‚Ä¢ Added by: Jane Smith
‚Ä¢ Status: Requested on LinkedIn
‚Ä¢ Date: 2025-10-12
‚Ä¢ Contact: Sarah Johnson

Are you contacting a DIFFERENT person at this company?

Click "OK" only if this is a different contact person.
Click "Cancel" to avoid duplicate work.
```

**Action**: 
- **Cancel**: Entry is not submitted
- **OK**: Entry proceeds (allows different contacts at same company)

### 3. üè¶ Financial Services Company Prevention

The system automatically detects financial/banking/fintech companies and **BLOCKS** submission with an error.

#### Detected Keywords

The following keywords trigger the financial services **BLOCK**:

**Banking & Finance:**
- fintech, finance, financing, financial
- banking, bank, banks
- nbfc (Non-Banking Financial Company)

**Insurance:**
- insurance, insure, insurer

**Investment & Trading:**

- mutual fund, fund management

**Lending & Credit:**
- credit, loan, lending, mortgage
- money, creditor

**Asset Management:**
- wealth, asset management, treasury

**Payment Services:**
- crypto wallet, payment gateway

#### How It Works

1. System checks company name against financial keywords
2. If match found, **BLOCKS submission** with error message
3. User must change company name to proceed

#### Example Scenario

```
‚ùå FINANCIAL COMPANY BLOCKED!

"FinTech Solutions Pvt Ltd" appears to be a 
financial/banking/fintech/insurance company.

We DO NOT accept entries from financial services companies.

Please change the company name to a non-financial company.
```

**Action**: 
- Submission is **BLOCKED**
- Focus returns to company name field
- User must enter a different company name

## Testing

3. Verify submission is **blocked**
4. Check error message shows correct details

### Test Company Warning

1. Create entry for "Microsoft Corp"
2. Try to create another entry for "Microsoft Corp"
3. Verify warning dialog appears
4. Test both "Cancel" and "OK" actions

### Test Financial Services Detection

Try these company names (should trigger warning):
- "FinTech Solutions"
- "ICICI Bank"
- "Bajaj Finance"
- "HDFC Insurance"
- "Paytm Payments Bank"
- "Zerodha Securities"

Should NOT trigger:
- "Tech Solutions Inc"

## Troubleshooting

### False Positives for Financial Companies

If a legitimate company is flagged (e.g., "Capital One Marketing" for a marketing role):
1. Click "OK" to proceed
2. Or temporarily modify company name
3. Or request keyword adjustment from admin

### Duplicate Warning for Different Contact

If you're contacting a different person at an existing company:
1. Review the warning details
2. Confirm it's a different contact person
3. Click "OK" to proceed
4. Entry will be saved with proper notes

### Toast Not Showing

If validation messages don't appear:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Ensure `showToast` function is loaded
3. Verify toast element is in DOM
4. Check z-index and positioning

## Best Practices

1. **Always review warnings carefully** before clicking OK
2. **Check company details** in the warning dialog
3. **Use "Cancel" when unsure** - better safe than duplicate
4. **Different contacts at same company are OK** - just confirm it
5. **Financial companies warning is guidance** - override if needed
6. **Keep contact information unique** - don't reuse email/phone/LinkedIn
7. **Coordinate with team** - check warnings to see who contacted whom

- ‚úÖ **No duplicate contact entries**

- ‚úÖ **Focus on relevant industries**
- ‚úÖ **Better team coordination**
