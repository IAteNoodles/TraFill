- ❌ "QuickLoan Services"
- ❌ "CryptoWallet Inc"
- ❌ "ICICI Bank"

## 💡 Tips to Avoid Blocking

### 1. **Check Company Name**
Before entering, verify the company is not in financial services sector.

### 2. **Use Generic Opportunity Types**
Instead of:
- ❌ "Finance Internship"
- ❌ "Banking Role"

Use:
- ✅ "Software Development Internship"
- ✅ "Data Analyst Role"
- ✅ "Product Manager"
- ✅ "Marketing Intern"

### 3. **Focus on Target Industries**
- Technology
- Healthcare
- E-commerce
- Manufacturing

- Telecommunications

### 4. **Avoid Ambiguous Names**
Be careful with companies that have financial-sounding names but aren't financial:
- "Capital One Marketing Agency" - May be blocked due to "Capital"
- "Investment Solutions Tech" - May be blocked due to "Investment"

In such cases, verify the company's actual business before attempting entry.
