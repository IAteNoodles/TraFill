## 🆕 What's New

### 1. 🚫 Duplicate Contact Prevention (HARD BLOCK)
**Prevents submission** if email, phone, or LinkedIn already exists in database.

**Why it matters:**
- No duplicate outreach to same contacts
- Prevents wasted team effort
- Maintains unique contact records

**User sees:**
```
❌ DUPLICATE ENTRY BLOCKED!

This contact information (email) already exists in the database:
Company: TechCorp Solutions
Added by: John Doe
Status: In Progress
Date: 2025-10-15

Please do not create duplicate entries!
```

### 2. ⚠️ Company Already Contacted Warning
**Warns** if company exists but **allows submission** for different contacts.

**Why it matters:**
- Team members know who contacted which company
- Allows multiple contacts at same company
- Prevents duplicate work on same contact

**User sees:**
```
⚠️ COMPANY ALREADY IN DATABASE

"Google Inc" has already been contacted 3 time(s).

Previous entry:
• Added by: Jane Smith
• Status: Requested on LinkedIn
• Date: 2025-10-12

Are you contacting a DIFFERENT person at this company?

[Cancel] [OK]
```

---

### 3. 🏦 Financial Services Detection
**Warns** about financial/banking/fintech companies but **allows override**.

**Why it matters:**
- Keeps focus on target industries
- Filters out typically unwanted sectors
- Saves time by flagging early

**Detected sectors:**
- Banking & Fintech
- Insurance
- Investment & Trading
- Credit & Lending
- Payment Gateways
- Asset Management

**User sees:**
```
⚠️ WARNING: "FinTech Solutions" appears to be 
a financial/banking/fintech company.

We typically don't need entries from financial services.

Are you sure you want to continue?

[Cancel] [OK]
```
